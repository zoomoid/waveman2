## waveman wave



### Synopsis


The wave painter draws a line that oscillates around a virtal zero axis, using the sample values as
wave peaks and valleys

The color of the line is set with --stroke-color, and the width of the line 
with --stroke-width. All those require SVG/CSS-compliant values for the
attributes.

Similarly to the box painter, the --height (or -h) flag controls the shape's overall
height. 

--spread (or -s) controls the horizontal spacing between each of the sample
points.

To make the line appear smoothly from a discrete set of points, we interpolate 
control points for each sample point using cubic hermetic interpolation to fit 
cubic polynomials. Namely, we implement 2 interpolation schemes: Fritsch-Carlson
and Steffen. Details can be seen here: 
http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/45218/implementation-of-monotone-cubic-interpolation
This way, the shape appears smooth. Interpolation can also be controlled with
flags: By default, the Frisch-Carlson scheme is used; setting "--interpolation steffen"
uses the Steffen scheme. If you want to disable interpolation entirely, set
"--interpolation none".

### Options

```
  -h, --help                   help for wave
      --interpolation string   Interpolation mechanism to be used for smoothing the curve [none,fritsch-carlson,steffen,akima] (default "fritsch-carlson")
      --stroke-color string    Color of the line's stroke (default "none")
      --stroke-width float     Width of the line's stroke
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --aggregator string          Determines the type of aggregator function to use. Chose one of 'max', 'avg', 'rounded-avg', 'mean-square', or 'root-mean-square' (default "rms")
  -n, --chunks int                 Chunks are the number of samples in the output of a transformation. For the Box painter, this also means the number of blocks, and for the Line painter, the number of root points of the line (default 64)
      --clamp-high float           Upper clipping of samples (default 1)
      --clamp-low float            Lower clipping of samples
      --downsampling-factor int    Determines the ratio of samples being used for downsampling compared to the full chunk's length. Given in powers of two up two 128 (default 1)
      --downsampling-mode string   Determines the downsampling mode, either by sampling samples from the start, the center, or the end of a chunk
  -f, --file strings               Determines the file to be sampled, can be relative to the current working directory
  -y, --height float               Height of the shape (default 200)
      --normalize                  Whether or not to normalize samples to [0,1]. When running in batch mode, this loses overall levels information, as each track is normalized individually
  -o, --output string              Writes the output to a given file. If not specified, writes output to stdout
  -r, --recursive                  Searches for all mp3 files in the directory below the specified file
  -w, --width float                Width of each element (default 10)
      --window string              Window algorithm. Defaults to rectangular, which is equivalent to no windowing. Can be used with other windowing algorithms to filter high sample values at the start and end of tracks. (default "rectangular")
      --window-p float             Window algorithm parameter. For most algorithms, this determines the steepness of the slope of the window
