## waveman box



### Synopsis


The box painter draws a simple box for each data point.

The box color can be set with --color.

The alignment axis can be either "top", "center", or "bottom",
and set with --alignment. 

--height (or -h) sets the height of highest box, thus also the
height of the entire canvas. 

--width (or -w) sets the width of each box's bounding box.

--gap sets the space left between each box. Boxes are painted centered inside 
their bounding box:

|-------------------------------------------|
|<- 0.5 * gap ->|----BOX----|<- 0.5 * gap ->|
|<----------------- width ----------------->|

--rounded (or -r) parameter controls the rounding of the rectangles.
Notably, rounding requires the boxes to have a minimum height, namely at least
the width of the box, to look aesthetically pleasing. When using --rounded,
each box's height will have its width as a lower bound.

### Options

```
      --alignment string   Alignment of the shapes, chose one of 'top', 'center', or 'bottom' (default "center")
      --color string       Fill color of each box (default "black")
      --gap float          Gap is the spacing left between each box. Boxes are centered horizonally, so half of gap is subtracted from the box's width (default 5)
  -h, --help               help for box
      --rounded float      Rounding factor of each box. Given in pixels. See SVG <rect> rx/ry attributes for details (default 10)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --aggregator string          Determines the type of aggregator function to use. Chose one of 'max', 'avg', 'rounded-avg', 'mean-square', or 'root-mean-square' (default "rms")
  -n, --chunks int                 Chunks are the number of samples in the output of a transformation. For the Box painter, this also means the number of blocks, and for the Line painter, the number of root points of the line (default 64)
      --clamp-high float           Upper clipping of samples (default 1)
      --clamp-low float            Lower clipping of samples
      --downsampling-factor int    Determines the ratio of samples being used for downsampling compared to the full chunk's length. Given in powers of two up two 128 (default 1)
      --downsampling-mode string   Determines the downsampling mode, either by sampling samples from the start, the center, or the end of a chunk
  -f, --file strings               Determines the file to be sampled, can be relative to the current working directory
  -y, --height float               Height of the shape (default 200)
      --normalize                  Whether or not to normalize samples to [0,1]. When running in batch mode, this loses overall levels information, as each track is normalized individually
  -o, --output string              Writes the output to a given file. If not specified, writes output to stdout
  -r, --recursive                  Searches for all mp3 files in the directory below the specified file
  -w, --width float                Width of each element (default 10)
      --window string              Window algorithm. Defaults to rectangular, which is equivalent to no windowing. Can be used with other windowing algorithms to filter high sample values at the start and end of tracks. (default "rectangular")
      --window-p float             Window algorithm parameter. For most algorithms, this determines the steepness of the slope of the window
